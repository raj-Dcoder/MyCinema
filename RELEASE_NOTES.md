# MyCinema v1.6.0 🚀

A monumental update that introduces true P2P downloading capabilities, completely overhauls the security model, and levels up the cinematic experience.

### 🌟 Features
- **P2P Download Engine**: Integrated WebTorrent with a beautiful side-panel UI for searching, streaming, and downloading movies and TV series effortlessly. Includes a brand-new introductory Grand Showcase tour.
- **Advanced Torrent Aggregation**: Dynamic search and filtering for High-Def releases across multiple high-performance trackers (YTS, EZTV) with node-based DNS-over-HTTPS fallback to bypass ISP blocks.
- **Persistent Download Management**: Your active, paused, and failed downloads are beautifully tracked and persist across app restarts automatically.

### 🛡️ Security & Privacy Audit
- **Strict Protocol Containment**: Removed `bypassCSP` loopholes from custom media protocols to completely mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) risks.
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Implemented rigorous whitelisting for all renderer-to-main file handlers, strictly limiting read access to user-selected libraries and application paths.
- **Safe External Links**: Validated and secured UI external links to prevent `javascript:` or `file:` URL payloads.
- **Local Network Obfuscation**: Disabled DHT and LSD in the WebTorrent configuration by default. Your IP and local network activity are completely hidden during downloads.
- **Optimized P2P Connections**: Reduced router overload by capping WebTorrent conns while injecting high-speed public trackers to maximize speed.
